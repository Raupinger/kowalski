# Kowalski

Kowalski is a small discord bot including some utility commands, reactionroles and a level up system using reactions.

## Add the bot to your discord

You can add the bot to your discord using either the
[administrator permissions invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815239326811947038&scope=bot&permissions=8)
or the
[minimal permissions invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=815239326811947038&scope=bot&permissions=268774464).

If you are using the minimal permissions invite link, make sure the custom role of the bot is ordered above all roles
the bot should be able to manage. (Otherwise it won't be able to assign them to the users.)

## Run locally

To run this bot locally, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, adjust the `config.json` file and then run
`npm start` to start an instance of the bot.
